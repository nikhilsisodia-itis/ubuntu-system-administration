# Introduction to Pipes and Redirections

## What are Pipes?

- Pipes are a powerful feature in Unix-like operating systems that allow you to connect the output of one command directly into the input of another command. This is done using the pipe operator `|`.
- Example:

  ```bash
  ls -l | grep "txt"
  ```

  In this example, the output of `ls -l` (which lists files in long format) is passed as input to `grep "txt"` (which filters the list to show only files containing "txt").

## What are Redirections?

- Redirections are used to change the standard input/output of commands. The most common redirection operators are `>`, `>>`, and `<`.
- `>`: Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it already exists.
- `>>`: Redirects the output of a command to a file, appending to the file if it already exists.
- `<`: Redirects the input of a command from a file instead of the keyboard.
- `2>`: Redirects the standard error output of a command to a file.
- `&>`: Redirects both standard output and standard error to a file.
- Example:

  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
  echo "Hello again!" >> output.txt
  cat < input.txt
  echo "This is an error message" 2> error.log
  ls non_existent_file &> error.log
  ```

  In this example, the first command writes "Hello, World!" to `output.txt`, the second command appends "Hello again!" to `output.txt`, the third command reads input from `input.txt`, the fourth command writes an error message to `error.log`, and the fifth command redirects both standard output and standard error to `error.log`.
