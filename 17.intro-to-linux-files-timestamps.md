# Introduction to Linux Files Timestamps

## What are Timestamps?

- Timestamps are metadata associated with files and directories that record specific times related to the file's lifecycle.
- There are three primary types of timestamps in Linux:
  - **Access Time (atime)**: The last time the file was read or accessed.
  - **Modification Time (mtime)**: The last time the file's content was modified.
  - **Change Time (ctime)**: The last time the file's metadata (like permissions or ownership) was changed.
- Each timestamp is stored as a Unix timestamp, which counts the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (the Unix epoch).

## Viewing Timestamps

- `stat <file_name>` command: Display the file's timestamps.
- `ls -lu`: Display the access time.
- `ls -lt`: Display the modification time.
- `ls -lc`: Display the change time.
- Use `touch <file_name>` command to update the timestamps.
- `touch -a <file_name>`: Update the access time.
- `touch -m <file_name>`: Update the modification time.
- `touch -c <file_name>`: Update the change time.
- `touch -t <timestamp> <file_name>`: Update the timestamp to the specified value.
- `date` command: Display the current date and time, which can be used to set timestamps.
**Note:** `touch <filename>` is mostly used to create empty files.
