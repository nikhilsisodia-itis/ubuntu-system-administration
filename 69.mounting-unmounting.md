# Mounting Filesystem

## Introduction

- Mounting a filesystem is the process of making a filesystem accessible at a certain point in the directory tree.
- This is done by associating a storage device (like a hard drive, SSD, or USB drive) with a directory (the mount point).
- Once mounted, the files and directories on the filesystem can be accessed through the mount point.
- Unmounting a filesystem is the process of detaching it from the directory tree, making it inaccessible until it is mounted again.
- Properly mounting and unmounting filesystems is crucial for data integrity and system stability.

## Mounting and Unmounting Commands

- Mounting is typically done using the `mount` command.
- The `mount` command attaches the filesystem found on a device to the directory tree at the specified mount point.
- The `umount` command is used to detach the filesystem from the directory tree.
- The `/etc/fstab` file contains information about filesystems and their mount points, allowing for automatic mounting at boot time.
- The `df` command displays information about disk space usage, including mounted filesystems.
- The `mount` command can also be used to view currently mounted filesystems without any arguments.
- The `findmnt` command provides a more detailed view of the mounted filesystems and their properties.
- The `lsblk` command lists information about all available block devices, including their mount points.
