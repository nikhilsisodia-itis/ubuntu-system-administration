# Introduction to Process Management

## What is Process Management?

Process management in Linux is the system's way of handling and controlling running programs. Here's what you need to know:

- **A process is a running program** - When you open an application or run a command, Linux creates a process for it with a unique ID (PID)

- **Every process has a parent** - Except for the init process (PID 1), all processes are created by other processes, forming a family tree structure

- **Processes can run in foreground or background** - Foreground processes interact with you directly, while background processes run quietly without user interaction

- **Linux manages process resources** - The system allocates CPU time, memory, and other resources to each process fairly using a scheduler

- **Processes have different states** - They can be running (actively using CPU), sleeping (waiting for something), stopped (paused), or zombie (finished but not cleaned up)

- **You can control processes** - Using commands like `ps`, `top`, `kill`, and `jobs`, you can view, monitor, start, stop, and manage running processes

- **Process priorities matter** - Some processes are more important than others, and Linux uses priority levels (nice values) to decide which processes get CPU time first

- **Signals are used for communication** - Processes can send and receive signals to communicate events like termination requests or interruptions.
