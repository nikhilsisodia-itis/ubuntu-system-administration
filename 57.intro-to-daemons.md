# Introduction to Daemons

## What is a Daemon?

- Daemons in Linux are background processes that run continuously without direct user interaction.
- The term "daemon" comes from "Disk And Execution MONitor" and represents system services that handle various tasks.
- Daemons typically have names ending in `d`.
- Syntax: `<service>d`: e.g., `sshd` (SSH daemon), `httpd` (HTTP daemon), `crond` (cron daemon).

## Key Characteristics

- **Background processes**: Run independently of user sessions
- **No controlling terminal**: Don't have direct user interface
- **Started at boot**: Typically launched during system initialization
- **Persistent**: Continue running until system shutdown or manually stopped
