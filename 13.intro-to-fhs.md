# Introduction to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

## What is FHS?

- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a set of guidelines that define the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.
- It provides a consistent layout for file systems, making it easier for users and developers to navigate and manage files.
- The FHS is maintained by the Linux Foundation and is widely adopted by many Linux distributions.
- The latest version of the FHS can be found on the [Linux Foundation website](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html).
- The FHS is important for ensuring compatibility and interoperability between different Linux distributions and software applications.
