# Linux Command Structure

## What is a Command?

- A command is an instruction given to the computer to perform a specific task.
- In Linux, commands are typically executed in a terminal or command-line interface (CLI).
- Commands can be built-in shell commands, external programs, or scripts.

## Basic Structure of a Command

- A command typically consists of three parts: the command name, options (or flags), and arguments.
  - The command name is the name of the program or utility that you want to run.
  - Options (or flags) are optional parameters that modify the behavior of the command. They usually start with a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--).
  - Arguments are the input or target for the command, such as file names or directories.
  - Example: `ls -a /home/user` where `ls` is the command name, `-a` is an option, and `/home/user` is an argument.
