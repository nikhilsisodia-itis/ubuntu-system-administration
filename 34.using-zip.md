# Using ZIP

## What is ZIP in Linux?

- `zip` is a command-line utility used to create ZIP archives, which are compressed files that can contain one or more files or directories.
- ZIP archives are widely used for file compression and archiving due to their compatibility across different operating systems.
- The `unzip` command is used to extract files from ZIP archives.
