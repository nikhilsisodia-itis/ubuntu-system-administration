# Running Commands Without a Trace

- Sometimes you want to run a command without leaving a trace of it in your shell history. This can be useful for sensitive commands or when you want to avoid cluttering your history with temporary commands.
- HISTCONTROL is an environment variable that sets the commands to ignore in the history.
- By default, the value of HISTCONTROL is ignoredups:ignorespace.
- `ignoredups` prevents duplicate entries from being saved in the history.
- `ignorespace` prevents commands that start with a space from being saved in the history.

## Using a Leading Space

- In many shells, including `bash` and `zsh`, you can configure your shell to ignore commands that start with a space. To enable this feature in `bash`, you can add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace
```

After adding this line, any command you type with a leading space will not be recorded in your history. For example:

```bash
 echo "This command will not be saved in history"
```

This command will execute normally, but it won't appear in your command history.

## Using `unset HISTFILE`

Another way to run commands without leaving a trace is to temporarily unset the `HISTFILE` variable, which controls where the history is saved. You can do this by running:

```bash
unset HISTFILE
```

After unsetting `HISTFILE`, any commands you run will not be saved to your history file. To restore normal history behavior, you can set `HISTFILE` back to its original value:

```bash
export HISTFILE=~/.bash_history
```

Make sure to replace `~/.bash_history` with the actual path to your history file if it's different.

## Using `history -d`

If you have already run a command and want to remove it from your history, you can use the `history -d` command followed by the line number of the command you want to delete. For example:

```bash
history
```

```bash
history -d 42
```

This will delete the command at line 42 from your history. You can find the line number by running `history` to list your recent commands.
