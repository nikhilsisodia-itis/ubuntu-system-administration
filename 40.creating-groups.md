# Introduction to Groups in Linux

## What are Groups?

- Groups in Linux are a fundamental part of the permission system that allow you to organize users and manage access to files, directories, and system resources efficiently.
- Instead of setting permissions for individual users, you can assign users to groups and set permissions for the entire group.
- There are two types of groups in Linux:
  - `Primary Group`:
    - Every user has exactly one primary group.
    - When a user creates a file, it's assigned to their primary group by default.
    - Specified in the `/etc/passwd` file (4th field).
  - `Secondary Groups`:
    - Users can belong to multiple secondary groups.
    - Provide additional permissions beyond the primary group.
    - Listed in `/etc/group` file.

## Why is creating Groups important?

- Security: Creating groups helps to limit access to sensitive files and system resources. Groups allow you to assign permissions to multiple users at once, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and simplifying permission management.
- Accountability: With well-organized groups, you can easily track which users have access to specific resources, which is important for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- Simplified Management: Groups allow administrators to manage permissions for multiple users simultaneously rather than setting individual permissions for each user.
- Resource Management: Different groups can have different levels of access to system resources, helping to manage system load and enforce resource quotas.
- Collaboration: Groups enable multiple users to collaborate on projects by sharing access to common files and directories while maintaining security boundaries.

## Understanding configuration files related to group management

### The `/etc/group` file

- The `/etc/group` file is a system configuration file that stores information about all groups on a Linux system.
- It's a plain text file that contains one line for each group, defining the group's properties and membership.
- There are four fields in each line in `/etc/group` file:
  - Field 1: Group name.
    - Example: `sudo`
  - Field 2: Group's password field. Encrypted password or 'x' for shadow password. If the second field is empty, that means the group member does not have to enter any password to use the group privileges or resources.
    - Example: `x`
  - Field 3: Groud ID(GID).
    - Example: `27`
  - Field 4: Contains a list of all the user(s) that are part of that group, separated by comma who belong to the specified group as a secondary group.
    Example: `user1, user2,user3`

**Note:** User's primary groups are defined the `/etc/passwd` file and not in the `etc/group` file. The `/etc/group` file ony contains details about secondary groups and its members.

## How to add or create new group(s)?

- `groupadd <groupname>`: Add a new group.
- `groupadd -g <gid> <groupname>`: Add a new group with a specific group ID.
