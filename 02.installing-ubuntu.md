# Installing Ubuntu

## As a Virtual Machine

- Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) or any other virtualization software of your choice.
- Download the latest Ubuntu ISO from the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
- Create a new virtual machine in your chosen virtualization software and follow the prompts to install Ubuntu using the downloaded ISO file.
- Allocate sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space) to the virtual machine based on your system's capabilities and your intended use.
- Start the virtual machine and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Ubuntu installation.
- Once the installation is complete, you can start using Ubuntu within the virtual machine.

## As the Host or Main OS

- Download the latest Ubuntu ISO from the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
- Create a bootable USB drive using tools like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (for Windows) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (for Windows, macOS, and Linux).
- Insert the bootable USB drive into your computer and restart it. You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS/UEFI settings to boot from the USB drive.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu. You can choose to install it alongside your existing operating system (dual-boot) or replace it entirely.
- Allocate sufficient disk space for Ubuntu based on your needs.
- Complete the installation process by following the prompts.
- After installation, remove the USB drive and restart your computer to boot into your new Ubuntu installation.

## Post-Installation Steps

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```
