# Introduction to Linux File System

- A `file system` is a way to organize, store and retrieve data on a storage device in a structured and logical manner.
- On a Linux System, everything is treated as a `file`, including all external devices like: USB, HardDrive, etc.
- If something is not a `file`, it is a `process`.
- In Linux, the `file system` follows a hierarchical structure- arranged in a Tree-like architecture.
- The root directory is the top-level directory in the `file system` or the base level.
- The root directory is represented by a forward slash `/`.
- All other directories and files are spreaded from the root or `/` directory.
- Linux follows `FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)` to maintain the `file system`.
- The FHS provides a standard layout for the directories and files, which ensures consistency across different Linux distributions.
- The directories or files present on different partitions or disks are also shown or mounted under the root directory.
- Mounting a `file system` means making the files and directories in the `file system` accessible to the user.
- Mount point is the directory where the `file system` is mounted.
- `df -h` command: Display the disk space usage.
