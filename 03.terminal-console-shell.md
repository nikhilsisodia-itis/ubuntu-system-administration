# Introduction to Terminal, Console, and Shell

## What is Terminal?

- Terminal also called as Terminal Emulator.
- It is a software application that provides a text-based interface to the system through a shell.
- GNOME Terminal is the default terminal in Ubuntu.
- It acts as a bridge inside the graphical user interface (GUI) to access the shell or command-line interface (CLI).

## What is Shell?

- Shell is also called as the command interpreter.
- It takes command from the user, interprets them, and then send it to the kernel for execution.

## What is Console?

- Console is a physical device (monitor and keyboard) to access the system.
- It is also called as TTY (teletypewriter).
- It bascially provides a text-based interface to the system, outside the GUI.

## What are Virtual Consoles?

- Virtual consoles are software-based terminals.
- Allow multiple independent sessions on the same computer.
- Each virtual console acts like a separate physical terminal, allowing same or different users to interact with the system simultaneously, even without a graphical interface.
