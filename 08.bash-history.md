# Bash History

## What is Bash History?

- Bash history is a feature of the Bash shell that keeps track of the commands you have executed in the terminal.
- It allows you to easily recall and re-execute previous commands without having to type them again.
- The history of commands is stored in a file called `.bash_history` in the user's home directory.
- The history feature is particularly useful for repetitive tasks, as it saves time and effort by allowing you to quickly access and reuse commands.
- The history feature can be customized using various environment variables and commands to suit your preferences and workflow.

## Key Points

- Bash shell starts in the user's home directory.
- .bash_history file stores the history of commands.
- HISTFILESIZE is an environment variable that sets the number of commands to store.
- To print the value of variable: echo $`<variable-name>`.
- By default, the value of HISTFILESIZE is 2000 (Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS).
- history command: Displays the history of commands from the .bash_history file.
- HISTSIZE is an environment variable that sets the number of commands to store in the memory.
- By default, the value of HISTSIZE is 1000 (Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS).
- The history in .bash_history is only saved when the terminal is closed.
- !<command_indexNumber>: Re-run the command with the specified index number.
- !!: Re-run the last command.
- !-n: Re-run the nth command from the last command.
- ctrl + p: Move to the previous command.
- ctrl + n: Move to the next command.
- ctrl + r: Search the command history.
- history -d <command_indexNumber>: Delete the command with the specified index number.
- history -c: Clear the history of commands.

## Difference between HISTFILESIZE and HISTSIZE

- `HISTFILESIZE`:
  - This variable determines the maximum number of lines (commands) that can be stored in the .bash_history file.
  - When the number of commands exceeds this limit, the oldest commands are removed to make space for new ones.
  - This setting affects the persistent storage of command history across terminal sessions.
- `HISTSIZE`:
  - This variable determines the number of commands to remember in the current session's history.
  - Unlike HISTFILESIZE, which affects the .bash_history file, HISTSIZE only impacts the in-memory history of the current shell session.
  - When the number of commands exceeds this limit, the oldest commands are removed from the in-memory history.
- In summary, HISTFILESIZE controls the size of the command history stored in the .bash_history file, while HISTSIZE controls the size of the command history available in the current shell session.
