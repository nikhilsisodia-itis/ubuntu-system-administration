# File Permissions in Linux

## Understanding File Permissions

- File permissions in Linux determine who can read, write, or execute a file.
- Each file has three types of permissions:
  - `read (r)`: Allows viewing the contents of the file.
  - `write (w)`: Allows modifying or deleting the file.
  - `execute (x)`: Allows running the file as a program.
  - `-`: Indicates that a particular permission is not granted.
- Permissions are assigned to three categories of users: the file owner, the group, and others.
- Permissions are represented in a string of 10 characters.
- The first character indicates the file type (e.g., `-` for a regular file, `d` for a directory).
- The next nine characters are divided into three sets of three, representing the permissions for the owner, group, and others.
- There are two ways to represent file permissions: symbolic and numeric (octal).

## Symbolic Representation

- In symbolic representation, permissions are shown as a string of characters.
- The first character indicates the file type:
  - `-`: Not a directory or special file.
  - `d`: Directory.
- The next nine characters are divided into three sets of three:
  - First set: Owner permissions `rwx`.
  - Second set: Group permissions `rwx`.
  - Third set: Others permissions `rwx`.
- Combination of this three character set with the first character is used to form a complete permission string.

## Numeric (Octal) Representation

- In numeric representation, permissions are represented using octal numbers.
- Each permission is assigned a specific value:
  - `read (r)`: 4
  - `write (w)`: 2
  - `execute (x)`: 1
  - `-`: 0
- The permissions for the owner, group, and others are summed up to form a three-digit octal number.
- The first character indicates the file type:
  - `-`: Not a directory or special file.
  - `d`: Directory.
- The next three digits represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others respectively:
  - First digit: Owner permissions `7`: `rwx` (4+2+1).
  - Second digit: Group permissions: `7`: `rwx` (4+2+1).
  - Third digit: Others permissions: `7`: `rwx` (4+2+1).
