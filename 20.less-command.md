# The `less` command

## What does the `less` command do?

- The `less` command is a terminal pager program used to view (but not modify) the contents of a text file one screen at a time.
- It allows you to scroll through the file both forwards and backwards, making it easier to read large files.
- It is particularly useful for viewing log files, configuration files, and other lengthy text documents.

## Basic usage of the `less` command

- To use the `less` command, simply type `less` followed by the name of the file you want to view. For example:

  ```bash
  less filename.txt
  ```

- This will open the file `filename.txt` in the `less` pager.
