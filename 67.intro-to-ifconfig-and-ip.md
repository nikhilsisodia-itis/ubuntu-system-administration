# Introduction to Ifconfig and IP

## What is ifconfig?

- `ifconfig` (interface configuration) is a traditional Linux command-line utility used to configure, control, and query TCP/IP network interface parameters.
- It allows you to view and modify network interface settings.

## Key Features of ifconfig

- Display network interface information.
- Configure IP addresses, netmasks, and broadcast addresses.
- Enable/disable network interfaces.

- `ifconfig` command: Display the network configuration.
- `ifconfig -a`: Display all the network configuration.
- `ifconfig <interface_name>`: Display detailed network information about the specific interface.
- `ifconfig <interface_name> up`: Enable the spcified interface.
- `ifconfig <interface_name> down`: Disable the spcified interface.

## What is the ip command?

- The `ip` command is the modern replacement for `ifconfig` and other legacy networking tools.
- It's part of the iproute2 package and provides more comprehensive network management capabilities.

### Key Features of ip command

- More powerful and flexible than ifconfig.
- Supports advanced networking features.
- Better scripting support.
- Unified interface for network configuration.
