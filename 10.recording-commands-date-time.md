# Recording Commands Date & Time

- You can record the date and time of a command execution.
- `HISTTIMEFORMAT` variable controls this feature.
- Set `HISTTIMEFORMAT` to a format string to include date and time in the history output.
- Example format:

```bash
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
```

- `%F` gives the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `%T` gives the time in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- After setting `HISTTIMEFORMAT`, use the `history` command to see timestamps.
- Example usage:

```bash
history
```

- This will display each command with its execution date and time.
- To make this change permanent, add the `HISTTIMEFORMAT` line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.
- Example of adding to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
echo 'HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Note:** You can also set custom formats using different format specifiers.

- For example:

```bash
echo 'HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%Y %T "' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- This will display the date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format with time in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- User can also add specifice words in the format, like:

```bash
echo 'HISTTIMEFORMAT="Executed: %d/%m/%Y at %T, Command: "' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- This will display the date and time with custom text before the command.
