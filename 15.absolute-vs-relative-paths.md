# Absolute Paths vs Relative Paths

## What are Absolute Paths?

- Absolute paths are the full path of a file or directory from the root directory.
- It uses forward slash `/` as the separator.
- Use `/` after every directory name.
- Example: `/home/username/Documents/`.

- They always point to the same location, regardless of the current working directory.

## What are Relative Paths?

- Relative paths are the path of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.
- It does not start with a forward slash (/).
- Use '.' to represent the current directory.
- Use '..' to represent the parent directory.
- Example: `cd Documents`.
- Example: `cd ..`.
- Relative paths are more flexible.
- They can change based on the current working directory.
