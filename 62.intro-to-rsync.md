# Introduction to rsync

## What is rsync?

- `rsync` stands for Remote Sync.
- It is a command-line utility for transferring and synchronizing files between hosts on a network.
- Efficiently transfer and synchronize files between hosts.
- `rsync` is a part of the rsync package.
- Uses a delta-transfer algorithm to minimize data transfer by only sending the differences between source and destination files.
- Can operate in both local and remote modes.

## rsync commands

- `rsync <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts.
- `rsync -a <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts preserving the file attributes.
- `rsync -r <source> <destination>`: Copy directories between hosts.
- `rsync -v <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts verbosely.
- `rsync -z <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts using compression.
- `rsync -P <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts using partial transfer.
- `rsync -l <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts using symbolic links.
- `rsync -t <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts preserving the modification times.
- `rsync -r -v -z -a -P -l -t <source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts recursively, verbosely, using compression, preserving the file attributes, using partial transfer, using symbolic links, and preserving the modification times.
- Using rsync over the network:
  - `rsync -avz -e "ssh -p <port>" <source> <username>@<hostname>:<destination>`: Copy files between hosts using rsync over the network.
  - `rsync -avz -e "ssh -p <port>" <username>@<hostname>:<source> <destination>`: Copy files between hosts using rsync over the network.
