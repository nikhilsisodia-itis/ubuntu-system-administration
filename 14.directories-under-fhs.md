# Directories under FHS

- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.
- Here are some of the key directories defined by the FHS:
  - `/bin` directory:
    - Consisit of essential user command binaries(executable programs- ls, rm, cat, etc).
    - These commands are available to all users and play a crucial role in the basic system functionality.
  - `/sbin` directory:
    - Consists of essential system command binaries(executable programs- fdisk, mkfs, etc).
    - These commands are available to the root user and play a crucial role in the system administration.
  - `/boot` directory:
    - Boot directory consist of all the files, that are required to start the system.
    - It contains the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image, and bootloader configuration files.
  - `/home` directory:
    - This directory consist of all the user's data.
    - Each user has its own personal directory within `/home`.
    - Every user's directory consist of user's personal files, configuration settings, and directories.
    - `/home` directory ensures that each user's files and settings are kept separate from others.
    - `~` is a shortcut for the current user's home directory.
    - `cd ~` is same as `cd /home/username`.
  - `/root` directory:
    - The root user's home directory.
    - The root user is the superuser or the administrator of the system.
    - The root user has full access to the system and can perform any operation.
  - `/dev` directory:
    - Device directory consist of all the device files.
    - These are special files that represent hardware devices like hard drives, USB drives, etc.
    - They are used to interact with the hardware devices.
    - Device files are created by the kernel when the system boots up.
    - These files are used to read and write data to the hardware devices.
    - Special files: Files that represents hardware devices or provides a mechanism for inter process communication.
  - `/etc` directory:
    - Etc directory consist of all the system configuration files.
    - Full form- etcetera.
    - System configuration files are used to configure the system settings.
    - These are used to set up the system according to the user's requirements.
    - System configuration files are used to configure the system services.
  - `/lib` directory:
    - Library directory consist of all the shared libraries.
    - Shared libraries are used by the system and the applications to perform various functions.
    - Shared libraries are loaded into the memory when the system boots up.
    - Shared libraries are used to provide common functions to the system and the applications.
  - `/media` directory:
    - Media directory consist of all the removable media devices.
    - External devices like USB drives, CD/DVD drives, etc. are mounted under the `/media` directory.
  - `/mnt` directory:
    - Mount directory consist of all the temporary mount points.
    - Mount points are used to mount external devices or network shares temporarily.
    - These points are used to access the data on the external devices or network shares.
  - `/tmp` directory:
    - Temporary directory consist of all the temporary files.
    - Temporary files are created by the system and the applications for temporary use.
    - Temporary files are deleted when the system reboots.
  - `/proc` directory:
    - Process directory consist of all the process information.
    - Process information is stored in the `/proc` directory.
    - This information is used by the system and the applications to manage the processes.
    - Process information is stored in the form of files and directories.
    - `cat /proc/cpuinfo`: Display the CPU information.
    - `cat /proc/meminfo`: Display the memory information.
  - `/sys` directory:
    - Sys directory consist of all the system information.
    - System information is stored in the `/sys` directory.
    - This information is used by the system and the applications to manage the system resources.
    - System information is stored in the form of files and directories.
  - `/srv` directory:
    - Service directory consist of all the service data.
    - This data is stored in the `/srv` directory.
    - Service data is used by the system and the applications to provide services.
    - Service data is stored in the form of files and directories.
  - `/run` directory:
    - Run directory consist of all the runtime data.
    - This data is stored in the `/run` directory.
    - Runtime data is used by the system and the applications during the system runtime.
    - This data is stored in the form of files and directories.
  - `/usr` directory:
    - User directory consist of all the user data.
    - User data is used by the system and the applications to provide user-specific data.
    - This data is stored in the form of files and directories.
  - `/var` directory:
    - Variable directory consist of all the variable data.
    - Variable data is used by the system and the applications to store variable data.
