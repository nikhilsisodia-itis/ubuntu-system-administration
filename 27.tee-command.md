# The `tee` commands

## What is the `tee` command?

- `tee` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files simultaneously.
- It is commonly used in shell scripting and command-line operations to capture the output of a command while still displaying it on the terminal.
- The name "tee" comes from the T-splitter used in plumbing, which splits a flow into two directions.
- The basic syntax of the `tee` command is:

  ```bash
  command | tee [options] [file...]
  ```

- Here, `command` is the command whose output you want to capture, and `file` is the file (or files) where you want to save the output.
- The `tee` command can take several options, such as:
  - `-a` or `--append`: Append the output to the specified file(s) instead of overwriting them.
  - `-i` or `--ignore-interrupts`: Ignore interrupt signals.
  - `--help`: Display help information about the command.
- Example usage of the `tee` command:

  ```bash
  ls -l | tee output.txt
  ```

  This command lists the files in the current directory and saves the output to `output.txt` while also displaying it on the terminal.
- Another example with the append option:

  ```bash
  echo "New line" | tee -a output.txt
  ```

  This command appends "New line" to `output.txt` without overwriting the existing content.
- The `tee` command is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to log the output of a command for later review while still being able to see the output in real-time.
