# Introduction to Jobs

## What are Jobs?

- Jobs are shell-specific concept representing one or more processes started from the same command line.
- Limites to the current shell session.
- Job numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) assigned by the shell.
- They are of two types:
  - Foreground jobs (blocking shell).
  - Background jobs (running independently).
- They are controlled via job control commands.

## Job Commands

- `jobs` command: Display the background jobs.
- `bg` command: Move a process to the background.
- `bg %<job_number>`: Move a process to the background using the job number.
- `fg` command: Move a process to the foreground.
- `fg %<job_number>`: Move a process to the foreground using the job number.
- `ctrl + z`: Suspend a process.
- `ctrl + c`: Terminate a process.
- `ctrl + d`: Exit the shell.
- `nohup <command>`: Run a command that does not terminate when the shell is closed.
