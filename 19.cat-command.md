# Introduction to the `cat` command in Linux

## What is the `cat` command?

- The `cat` command, short for "concatenate," is a standard Unix/Linux command used to read, display, and concatenate files.
- It is commonly used to view the contents of text files, combine multiple files into one, and create new files.
- The `cat` command is simple yet powerful, making it a staple in the toolkit of Linux users.

## Basic syntax of the `cat` command

```bash
cat [options] [file1] [file2] ...
```

- `options`: Various flags that modify the behavior of the `cat` command.
- `file1`, `file2`, ...: The files you want to read or concatenate.

## Commonly used options with the `cat` command to display file contents

- `-n`: Number all output lines.
- `-b`: Number non-blank output lines.
- `-s`: Squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines into a single blank line.
- `-E`: Display a `$` at the end of each line.
- `-T`: Display tab characters as `^I`.
- `-A`: Equivalent to `-vET`, shows non-printing characters, ends of lines, and tabs.
- `-v`: Show non-printing characters (except for tabs and end-of-line characters).

## Concatenating files using the `cat` command

- You can concatenate multiple files into one by specifying the files in the command.
- Example: `cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt` will combine `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into a new file called `combined.txt`.
- You can also append the contents of one file to another using the `>>` operator.
- Example: `cat file1.txt >> file2.txt` will append the contents of `file1.txt` to the end of `file2.txt`.

## Creating new files using the `cat` command

- You can create a new file and add content to it using the `cat` command.
- Example: `cat > newfile.txt` will create a new file called `newfile.txt` and allow you to type content into it. Press `CTRL+D` to save and exit.
- You can also use `cat` to create a file with multiple lines of text.
- Example:

  ```bash
  cat <<EOF > newfile.txt
  This is line 1.
  This is line 2.
  This is line 3.
  EOF
  ```

- This will create `newfile.txt` with three lines of text.
**Note:** The `<<EOF` syntax is called a "here document" and allows you to input multiple lines of text until the specified delimiter (`EOF` in this case) is reached.
- The delimiter can be any string, not just `EOF`. Just ensure that the same string is used to start and end the input.
- Example:

  ```bash
  cat <<INPUT > anotherfile.txt
  Content here
  INPUT
  ```

- This will create `anotherfile.txt` with the content "Content here".
