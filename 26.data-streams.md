# Data Streams in Linux

## What are Data Streams?

- Data streams refer to the flow of data between commands, files, and devices.
- There are three standard data streams in Linux:
  1. **Standard Input (stdin)**: This is the default source of input for commands, typically the keyboard. The input stream that carries data into a command. It is represented by file descriptor `0`.
  2. **Standard Output (stdout)**: This is the default destination for output from commands, typically the terminal screen. The output stream that carries data out of a command. It is represented by file descriptor `1`.
  3. **Standard Error (stderr)**: This is the default destination for error messages from commands, also typically the terminal screen. The error stream that carries error messages out of a command. It is represented by file descriptor `2`.

## Using Data Streams

- You can redirect these data streams using various operators:
  - `>`: Redirects standard output to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.

    ```bash
    echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
    
    ```

  - `>>`: Redirects standard output to a file, appending to the file if it exists.

    ```bash
    echo "Hello again!" >> output.txt
    ```

  - `<`: Redirects standard input from a file.

    ```bash
    cat < input.txt
    ```

  - `2>`: Redirects standard error to a file.

    ```bash
    ls non_existent_file 2> error.log
    ```

  - `&>`: Redirects both standard output and standard error to a file.

    ```bash
    command &> output_and_error.log
    ```

  - `|`: Pipes the standard output of one command to the standard input of another command.

    ```bash
    ls -l | grep "txt"
    ```

  - `tee`: Reads from standard input and writes to both standard output and one or more files.

    ```bash
    ls -l | tee output.txt
    ```
