# Finding files using the `find` command

## What is `find`?

- `find` is a command-line utility that allows you to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on various criteria such as name, type, size, modification date, and permissions.
- It performs a real-time search of the filesystem, which can be slower than using `locate`, especially on large filesystems.
- `find` is very powerful and flexible, allowing for complex search patterns and actions to be performed on the found files.
