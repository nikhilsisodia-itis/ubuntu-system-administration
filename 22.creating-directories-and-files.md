# Creating Directories and Files

## What are Directories and Files?

- Directories (or folders) are used to organize files on your computer.
- Files are individual documents or data stored on your computer.

## Creating Directories

- `mkdir <directory_name>`: Creates a new directory with the specified name.
  - Example: `mkdir my_folder` creates a directory named "my_folder".
- `mkdir -p <path/to/directory>`: Creates nested directories. If the parent directories do not exist, they will be created.
  - Example: `mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild` creates the entire path
  - If "parent" or "child" do not exist, they will be created.
- `ls`: Lists the contents of the current directory, allowing you to see the newly created directories.
- `cd <directory_name>`: Changes the current directory to the specified directory.
  - Example: `cd my_folder` changes the current directory to "my_folder".
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory, showing your location in the file system.
- `rmdir <directory_name>`: Removes an empty directory.
  - Example: `rmdir my_folder` removes the directory named "my_folder" if it is empty.
