# Introduction to Compressing and Archiving

## What is Compressing?

- Compressing is the process of reducing the size of files or data to save storage space or to make them easier to transmit over networks.
- Compression can be lossless (no data is lost) or lossy (some data is lost, typically for media files).
- Common compression algorithms include ZIP, GZIP, and BZIP2.

## What is Archiving?

- Archiving is the process of combining multiple files into a single file, often for easier storage or transfer.
- Archiving does not necessarily reduce file size, but it organizes files into a single container.
- Common archiving formats include TAR, ZIP, and RAR.

## Compressing and Archving in Linux

- In Linux, you can use various command-line tools to compress and archive files.
- Some common tools include:
  - `tar`: Used for archiving files. It can also compress files when used with compression options.
  - `gzip`: Used for compressing files using the GZIP algorithm.
  - `bzip2`: Used for compressing files using the BZIP2 algorithm.
  - `zip`: Used for creating ZIP archives.
  - `unzip`: Used for extracting files from ZIP archives.
  - `7z`: Used for creating and extracting 7-Zip archives.
