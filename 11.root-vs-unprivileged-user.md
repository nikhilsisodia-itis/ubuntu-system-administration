# Root VS Unprivileged User

## What is Root?

- Root is the superuser account in Unix and Linux systems.
- It has unrestricted access to all commands and files on the system.
- The root user can perform any administrative task, including installing software, changing system configurations, and managing user accounts.
- The root user is typically represented by the username "root" and has a user ID (UID) of 0.
- The root user can bypass file permissions and access any file on the system, regardless of its ownership or permission settings.

## What is an Unprivileged User?

- An unprivileged user is a regular user account that has limited access to system resources and files.
- Unprivileged users can only access files and directories that they own or that have been explicitly granted to them by the system administrator.
- Unprivileged users cannot perform administrative tasks, such as installing software or changing system configurations.
- Unprivileged users are typically represented by usernames other than "root" and have user IDs (UIDs) greater than 0.
- Unprivileged users are subject to file permissions and cannot access files that they do not have permission to read, write, or execute.

## Gaining Root Access

- Unprivileged users can gain temporary root access using commands like `sudo` or `su`, provided they have been granted the necessary permissions by the system administrator.
- The `sudo` command allows an unprivileged user to execute a command with root privileges, while the `su` command allows a user to switch to the root user account.
- It is important to use root access judiciously, as it can lead to accidental system changes or security vulnerabilities if misused.
- Best practices recommend using root access only when necessary and reverting to an unprivileged user account for regular tasks to minimize the risk of accidental damage to the system.

## Commands to gain root access

- Execute single command as root
`sudo command`

- Switch to root shell temporarily
`sudo -i`

- Switch to root user account
`sudo su -`
