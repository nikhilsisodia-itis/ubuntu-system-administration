# Copying and Moving Files and Directories

## What is Copying?

- Copying a file or directory means creating a duplicate of it in a new location.
- The original file or directory remains unchanged in its original location.
- The copied file or directory can be modified independently of the original.
- Copying is useful for creating backups or transferring files without altering the original.

## What is Moving?

- Moving a file or directory means changing its location within the file system.
- This can involve changing its parent directory or renaming it.
- Moving does not create a copy; it simply updates the file system to reflect the new location.
- When you move a file or directory, the original location no longer contains the item.
- Moving is often faster than copying because it typically involves updating pointers rather than duplicating data.

## Command to Copy Files and Directories

- `cp` is the commands used to copy files and directories in Unix-like operating systems.
- `cp <source> <destination>` is the basic syntax.
  - `<source>`: The file or directory you want to copy.
  - `<destination>`: The location where you want to place the copied file or directory.
- To copy directories, use the `-r` (recursive) option: `cp -r <source_directory> <destination_directory>`.
  - This copies the entire directory and its contents to the new location.

## Command to Move Files and Directories

- `mv` is the command used to move files and directories in Unix-like operating systems.
- `mv <source> <destination>` is the basic syntax.
  - `<source>`: The file or directory you want to move.
  - `<destination>`: The new location or name for the file or directory.
- `mv` can also be used to rename files or directories by specifying a new name in the destination.
- `mv -v` can be used for verbose output, showing what is being moved.
- `mv -i` can be used to prompt before overwriting files.
- `mv -n` can be used to prevent overwriting existing files.
- `mv -u` can be used to move only when the source file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing.
- `mv -f` can be used to force the move without prompting, even if it overwrites files.
