# The `ls` command in-depth

## What is `ls`?

- `ls` is a command-line utility used to list files and directories in Unix-like operating systems.
- It provides various options to customize the output, making it a versatile tool for file management.

## Basic usage and common flags or options

- Basic command: `ls`
- Common flags:
  - `-l`: Long format listing, showing detailed information about each file (permissions, owner, size, modification date).
  - `-a`: Show all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot).
  - `-h`: Human-readable format for file sizes (e.g., KB, MB).
  - `-R`: Recursively list subdirectories.
  - `-t`: Sort by modification time, with the newest files first.
  - `-r`: Reverse the order of the sort.
  - `-S`: Sort by file size, with the largest files first.
  - `-d`: List directories themselves, not their contents.
  - `-i`: Display the inode number of each file.
  - `-F`: Append a character to each file name indicating its type (e.g., `/` for directories, `*` for executables).

**Note:** The `ls` command is an alias for `ls --color=auto` on many systems, which adds color coding to the output based on file types. The original `ls` command without color coding is `\ls`.
